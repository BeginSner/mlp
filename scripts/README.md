## 1: task1.py:
    task1.py is for training of changing network width and depth.
    If you want to run both of them, I have put it in the coursework_1.ipynb.
    If you want to run in task1.py, you should manually change some hyperparameters and plot settings.

## 2: task2.py:
    task2.py is for dropout and L1&L2 penalty. 
    If you want to run the training, you should uncomment line.169, and comment line.153 of the os.environ setting. The last step is to select from the 3 models from line.67 to line.102. just leave one of them work will be ok.
    If you want to run the ploting of the data based on the Table 3 in report. You can just comment everything except lines after line 170.
    
    Tips: The seed in task2 is different from the original one in task1.
